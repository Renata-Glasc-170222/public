# Atelier Echo — Minimal Static Web Shop (HTML + CSS)

What this is
- Four static pages with an artistic, tactile visual style:
  - index.html — Home / hero / featured pieces / contact
  - shop.html — Product listing with simple filters and cards
  - product.html — Single product detail / purchase form (static)
  - gallery.html — Small gallery/masonry view

How to use
1. Download all files into the same folder.
2. Open index.html in your browser.
3. No build step or server required. Everything is static and CSS-only.

Customization tips
- Replace gradient "visuals" with real images by swapping the background styles on .card-visual, .thumb-visual, .hero-slab and .m-item (use background-image: url('assets/img.jpg')).
- Edit fonts at the top of each HTML to change typography.
- Add small JavaScript for cart and dynamic behaviors if needed.

License
- Feel free to adapt for your own portfolio or shop demos.
